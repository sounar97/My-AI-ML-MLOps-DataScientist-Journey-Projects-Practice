**Unsupervised Learning**
Unsupervised learning involves training models on unlabeled data.
Clustering vs. Dimensionality Reduction:
1.Clustering: Grouping similar data points.
2.Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing data dimensions.
Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:
1.K-Means Clustering
2.Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
3.t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
