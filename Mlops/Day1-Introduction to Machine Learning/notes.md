What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
Types of Machine Learning:
Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data.
Unsupervised Learning: Learning from unlabeled data.
Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interactions.
Key ML Concepts:
Model: Mathematical representation of data.
Training: Teaching model from data.
Testing: Evaluating model performance.
