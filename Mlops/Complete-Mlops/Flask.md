Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that plays a significant role in MLOps, primarily for **model deployment and serving**. Here's a brief usage overview:

**1. Creating a REST API for your ML Model**
   * The core use of Flask in MLOps is to expose your trained machine learning model as a web API, typically a RESTful API. This allows other applications or services to send input data to your model and receive predictions.
   * You'll create Flask routes (endpoints) that:
     * Receive incoming requests (e.g., via `POST` methods).
     * Extract input data from the request (often in JSON format).
     * Preprocess the input data to match the format expected by your model.
     * Load your trained ML model (e.g., using `joblib`, `pickle`, or `tensorflow.keras.models.load_model`).
     * Make predictions using the loaded model.
     * Return the predictions as a JSON response.

**Example Flask snippet for prediction:**

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import joblib # or pickle, tensorflow, etc. for loading your model

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load your trained model once when the application starts
# This assumes your model is saved as 'my_model.pkl' in a 'models' directory
model = joblib.load('models/my_model.pkl') 

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.json # Get JSON data from the request
    # Perform any necessary data preprocessing here
    # For example, if your model expects a pandas DataFrame:
    # df = pd.DataFrame([data]) 
    
    prediction = model.predict([data['features']]) # Make prediction

    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction.tolist()}) # Return prediction as JSON

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

**2. Integration with MLOps Tools**
   * **Docker:** Flask applications are commonly containerized using Docker. This bundles your Flask app, its dependencies, and your ML model into a single, portable unit that can be run consistently across different environments (development, staging, production).
   * **CI/CD Pipelines:** Flask applications can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines (e.g., using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI). This automates the process of building the Flask application, running tests, creating Docker images, and deploying the model to production.
   * **MLflow:** While Flask is for serving, MLflow is used for tracking experiments, managing models, and registering them. You can use MLflow to load a registered model within your Flask application for deployment.
   * **Monitoring:** Flask can be set up to expose metrics (e.g., using `prometheus_client`) that can be scraped by monitoring tools like Prometheus and visualized in Grafana to track model performance, API usage, and errors in production.

**3. Why Flask for MLOps?**
   * **Lightweight and Simple:** Flask is a "micro" framework, meaning it has a minimal core and is easy to learn and use, making it ideal for creating simple APIs specifically for model serving.
   * **Flexibility:** It provides a lot of flexibility, allowing you to build exactly what you need without much boilerplate.
   * **Python Ecosystem:** Being a Python framework, it integrates seamlessly with the vast Python data science and machine learning ecosystem.

In essence, Flask serves as the "delivery mechanism" for your trained ML models, transforming them into accessible web services that can be integrated into larger applications and managed within an MLOps pipeline.
